# yet-another-xcode-theme
Light / dark modes color theme I made for Xcode, inspired on my Yet Another Color Theme for VSCode.

In order to use the theme, follow these steps:

📥 Installation

    1) Download the .xccolortheme files.

    2) Move them to:

    ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/UserData/FontAndColorThemes/

⚙️ Activation

    Open Xcode.

    Go to Xcode > Settings > Themes (or Preferences > Fonts & Colors in older versions).

    Select the theme from the list. It will be available in either light or dark mode.
